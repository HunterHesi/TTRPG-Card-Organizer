# TTRPG-Card-Organizer
This project is to make a digital card organizer that users can upload image files to in order to save loadouts and and quickly add new content. 

Steps for use:
1. Extract the Zip File.
   ***make sure it is where you want it before launching as moving it after saving profiles could result in your profiles not working***

3. Launch the Exe tilted card_manager

4. Click "Cards" at the top, then "Load Card Directory"

5. Select the folder named 'cards' in the same folder as the exe.

You can now add cards to your colleciton! Make sure to save your profile. The "profiles folder" is prolvided but you may save the file anywhere you'd like.

You may load profiles without loading the Directy.

You can add new cards to the Card Folder and they will be loaded the next time you select "Load Card Directory".
